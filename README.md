# Nonparametric multiple changepoint detection for multivariate data

In this project, I provide a python implementation of the divisive algorithm from an excellent non-parametric changepoint detection paper below.

```Matteson, David S., and Nicholas A. James. "A nonparametric approach for multiple change point analysis of multivariate data." Journal of the American Statistical Association 109.505 (2014): 334-345.``` - [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.4933.pdf)

The authors of the paper have provided an R package with extra algorithms discussed in the paper - [GitHub](https://github.com/cran/ecp)

I also provide a Jupyter notebook evaluating the algorithm on synthetic dataset.
